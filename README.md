## Overview

The Integrated Assignment Environment is designed to facilitate the compilation and interpretation of source code using user-defined configurations. It supports multiple programming languages such as C, C++, Java, and Python. By providing a user-friendly interface and a flexible configuration system, the software aims to simplify the process of compiling and running source code files and displaying compare result of submission file(s) and configuration file(s).

## Features

- Compile and interpret source code files written in C, C++, Java, and Python.
- Support for custom configuration files to define project settings.
- Automatic generation of compilation and execution commands based on the configuration.
- Execution of the compiled or interpreted code with customizable arguments.
- Comparison of output with expected results for displaying purposes.
- Error handling and informative messages for easier troubleshooting.
- Integration with external libraries, such as Jackson for JSON serialization/deserialization.
