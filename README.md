## Overview

The Integrated Assignment Environment is designed to facilitate the compilation and interpretation of source code using user-defined configurations. It supports multiple programming languages such as C, C++, Java, and Python. By providing a user-friendly interface and a flexible configuration system, the software aims to simplify the process of compiling and running source code files and displaying compare result of submission file(s) and configuration file(s).

## Features

- Compile and interpret source code files written in C, C++, Java, and Python.
- Support for custom configuration files to define project settings.
- Automatic generation of compilation and execution commands based on the configuration.
- Execution of the compiled or interpreted code with customizable arguments.
- Comparison of output with expected results for displaying purposes.
- Error handling and informative messages for easier troubleshooting.
- Integration with external libraries, such as Jackson for JSON serialization/deserialization.

## Installation

To install and run the The Integrated Assignment Environment (IAE), follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/emreevcin/CE316.git`
2. Install the required dependencies with Maven.
3. Build the project using the provided build scripts or IDE tools.
4. Run the application using the generated executable or by executing the appropriate command.

Note: Make sure you have the necessary runtime environment and dependencies installed on your system to run the application successfully.

## Usage

1. Launch the Integrated Assignment Environment application.
2. Create or load a Configuration.For creating new one, define the project configurations, such as the programming language, file selection, command-line arguments, and external libraries.
3. Create a new project with one of existing Configurations.
4. Add student files inside Submission Page.
6. View the output generated by the execution.

Refer to the user manual or documentation for detailed usage instructions.

## Configuration

The Integrated Assignment Environment utilizes a configuration system to define project settings. The configuration file allows users to specify the programming language, file directories, command-line arguments, and external library dependencies with the help of user interface. 

The configuration file is written in JSON format and can be created or modified using a text editor. An example configuration file is provided in the `config` directory.

For more information on how to customize the configuration, refer to the documentation or user manual.
